# Advent of Code 2024
This project was written in Python as the puzzles were released. I didn't try to go for a leaderboard placement in any of the puzzles as their release was very suboptimal for me (6AM local time).

## Various notes on puzzles

| **Day** | **Notes/Thoughts**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 3       | While I've used RegEx in the past, it still took me a while to get it right. Mostly because I thought `.` does mean "all characters", not "all characters except line break".  Also the second part of this day could have probably be done in fewer RegExes.               |
| 4       | This was rather nice, even though I'm sick and my head's all cloudy I think I managed to get a pretty good solution. Also I was able to (kinda) recycle the Vector dataclass I've written a while ago for my [Hitomezashi generator](https://github.com/Schlecknits/hitomezashi). |
